Major Improvements (to be found in application_sqlite.py file)

Consolidated Backup Function:

Removed the duplicate backup_db_to_s3() function
Improved error handling and logging


Force SQLite Option:

Added a FORCE_SQLITE environment variable to easily switch to SQLite mode
This lets you force SQLite even if DATABASE_URL is present


Automatic Scheduled Backups:

Added a before_request hook to check if a backup is needed
Backups will happen at most once per hour
This provides automatic protection of your SQLite data


Better Organization:

Code is organized more logically, with S3 availability check at the top
Clearer decision tree for database configuration



AWS App Runner Configuration Updates
To use this with App Runner, update your environment variables:

Set FORCE_SQLITE=true to always use SQLite regardless of DATABASE_URL
Set S3_BUCKET=your-actual-bucket-name for backups
Make sure your App Runner service has IAM permissions to access the S3 bucket

This configuration will:

Always use SQLite for your database
Download the latest backup from S3 at startup
Backup to S3 once per hour
Support all your user tracking functionality

The SQLite database will be stored in the application's working directory, which is ephemeral in App Runner. That's why the S3 backup is crucial - it ensures your data persists even if the App Runner instance is replaced.

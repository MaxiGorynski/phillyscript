PhillyScript Project - Comprehensive Diagnostic Status Report
Project Purpose
PhillyScript is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize property inspection documentation by transforming audio recordings into structured, actionable data. The solution addresses the inefficiencies of manual property inspection reporting through automated transcription and intelligent data processing.
Comprehensive Technical Architecture
Core Technologies

Web Framework: Flask (Python 3.8)
Backend Infrastructure:

AWS App Runner
VPC-based networking


Database: PostgreSQL on AWS RDS
AI Integration:

Google Speech-to-Text API (Audio Transcription)
OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo (Transcript Correction)


Data Processing:

Pandas for CSV manipulation
Custom parsing algorithms for structured extraction



Deployment Environment

Cloud Provider: Amazon Web Services
Hosting Service: App Runner
Networking Model:

Private subnets
NAT Gateway for internet connectivity
VPC connector for service integration



Detailed Migration and Networking Evolution
Initial Configuration

Originally used SQLite for local development
Simple, direct network connectivity
Minimal external API dependencies

Migration Challenges

Database Transition

Migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL
Moved to AWS RDS for scalable, managed database solution
Required comprehensive connection string and authentication updates


Network Infrastructure Transformation

Implemented AWS App Runner with VPC networking
Introduced complex subnet routing
Required NAT Gateway for outbound internet access



Networking Configuration Milestones

Created three private subnets for App Runner
Established dedicated public subnet for NAT Gateway
Resolved initial circular routing problem
Configured route tables to enable controlled internet access

Diagnostic Journey and Connectivity Testing
OpenAI API Connectivity
Initial State

Encountered 421 "Misdirected Request" error
Suspected HTTP protocol compatibility issue

Diagnostic Findings

Successfully retrieved model list
Confirmed API key functionality
Identified potential HTTP/2 vs HTTP/1.1 conflict

Resolution Approach

Implemented explicit HTTP/1.1 configuration
Added comprehensive error logging
Created custom OpenAI client with network-aware initialization

Database Connectivity
Connection Challenges

Transitioned from local SQLite to remote PostgreSQL
Required updated connection management
Needed to handle VPC networking complexities

Diagnostic Process

Created detailed connectivity test route
Verified RDS instance accessibility
Confirmed network routing to database
Retrieved database server details

PostgreSQL 17.2
Running on aarch64 architecture
Compiled with GCC 12.4.0



Transcription Pipeline Disruption
Observed Symptoms

Google Speech-to-Text API calls timing out
Error: "Network is unreachable"
Transcript processing seemingly bypassed

Potential Root Causes

Network routing restrictions
Misconfigured VPC security groups
SSL/TLS negotiation failures
Incomplete error handling in transcription logic

Technical Diagnostic Artifacts Created
Implemented Test Routes

/test_openai

Validates OpenAI API connectivity
Retrieves available models
Captures detailed error information


/test_database

Tests PostgreSQL connection
Retrieves system and connection metadata
Validates network routing



Logging and Error Tracking

Enhanced logging configuration
Detailed error capture mechanisms
Unique identifier generation for request tracing

Current System Capabilities
✓ Basic web application structure operational
✓ Database connection established
✓ OpenAI API basic connectivity confirmed
⚠️ Transcription pipeline requires comprehensive debugging
Comprehensive Hypothesis
The network reconfiguration has introduced nuanced connectivity challenges:

Potential SSL/TLS negotiation conflicts
Subtle routing restrictions in VPC
Incomplete error handling in external API interactions

Recommended Diagnostic Progression

Implement granular API call logging
Create explicit network configuration validation
Develop comprehensive error tracking in transcription workflow
Perform systematic, isolated testing of each pipeline component

Proposed Next Investigation Vectors

Detailed network trace analysis
Explicit SSL/TLS configuration
Enhanced error propagation in transcription logic
Isolated testing of Speech-to-Text API calls

Environmental Context

Python Version: 3.8.20
System: Linux (Amazon Linux 2)
Deployment: AWS App Runner
Database: PostgreSQL 17.2 on aarch64

Potential Performance and Security Considerations

Evaluate current VPC subnet configuration
Review security group rules
Assess current error handling and logging strategies
Consider implementing circuit breaker patterns for API interactions

Phase 1: Railway Setup (2 hours)

Create Railway project:

bashrailway login
railway init phillyscript

Add PostgreSQL service in Railway dashboard
Connect your GitHub repo to Railway project

Phase 2: Code Preparation (1 hour)
Critical insight: Your networking issues will disappear on Railway because:

No VPC/NAT Gateway complexity
Automatic SSL termination
Built-in external API connectivity

Required changes (minimal):

Remove AWS-specific code:

python# Remove/simplify these in application.py:
- boto3 S3 backup functions (lines ~90-130)
- Custom HTTP client for OpenAI (lines ~45-65)
- Complex database connection logic

Add Railway configuration:

Create railway.json:
json{
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "gunicorn application:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120"
  }
}
Create Procfile:
web: gunicorn application:application --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT --timeout 120 --workers 2
Phase 3: Environment Variables
Migrate these from AWS App Runner to Railway:
DATABASE_URL → (Railway auto-provides)
OPENAI_API_KEY → [your key]
SECRET_KEY → [your secret]
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS → [service account JSON]
Phase 4: File Storage Strategy
Since you're using /tmp/ for temporary files, no changes needed:

Railway provides ephemeral storage for temp files
Your workflow (upload → process → download → cleanup) works perfectly
No persistent storage required

Phase 5: Database Migration

Export from current RDS:

bashpg_dump $CURRENT_DATABASE_URL > backup.sql

Import to Railway:

bashpsql $RAILWAY_DATABASE_URL < backup.sql
Expected Resolution of Current Issues
Your troubleshooting document shows you've been fighting:

❌ VPC networking complexity
❌ NAT Gateway routing issues
❌ Network ACL conflicts
❌ App Runner networking limitations
❌ SSL/TLS negotiation problems

Railway eliminates ALL of these:

✅ No VPC - direct internet connectivity
✅ Automatic SSL termination
✅ Built-in external API access
✅ No NAT Gateway needed
✅ No Network ACLs to configure

Migration Timeline
Day 1 (4 hours):

Set up Railway project
Configure database
Deploy application
Migrate environment variables

Day 2 (2 hours):

Test all functionality
Update DNS
Monitor and optimize

Immediate Next Steps

Create Railway account and new project
Export your current database as backup
Push your code to GitHub (if not already there)

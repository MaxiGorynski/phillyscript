For Transcription

-Transcription is arranged in terms of 'Features' and 'Comments'
-Open your preferred dictaphonic/voice memoing application
-When you wish to record a new Feature in an inventory, say 'New Feature', followed by the name of the new feature
-Then, for each comment or observation you wish to make about the feature in question, say 'Comment'
-Each time you say 'Comment', what you say immediately after will be stored in that comment
-When you are ready to move on to the next feature, simply say 'New Feature', followed by the name of your new feature, then add comments as before
